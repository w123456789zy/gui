## Model Introduction

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become foundational components of intelligent systems. As real-world AI tasks grow
increasingly complex, VLMs must evolve beyond basic multimodal perception to enhance their reasoning capabilities in
complex tasks. This involves improving accuracy, comprehensiveness, and intelligence, enabling applications such as
complex problem solving, long-context understanding, and multimodal agents.

Based on the [GLM-4-9B-0414](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4) foundation model, we present the new open-source VLM model
**GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking**, designed to explore the upper limits of reasoning in vision-language models. By introducing
a "thinking paradigm" and leveraging reinforcement learning, the model significantly enhances its capabilities. It
achieves state-of-the-art performance among 10B-parameter VLMs, matching or even surpassing the 72B-parameter
Qwen-2.5-VL-72B on 18 benchmark tasks. We are also open-sourcing the base model GLM-4.1V-9B-Base to
support further research into the boundaries of VLM capabilities.

Compared to the previous generation models CogVLM2 and the GLM-4V series, **GLM-4.1V-Thinking** offers the
following improvements:

1. The first reasoning-focused model in the series, achieving world-leading performance not only in mathematics but also
   across various sub-domains.
2. Supports **64k** context length.
3. Handles **arbitrary aspect ratios** and up to **4K** image resolution.
4. Provides an open-source version supporting both **Chinese and English bilingual** usage.

The following results are based on image fine-tuning using the [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory)
toolkit.

| Device (Cluster) | Strategy   | Min Memory / # of GPUs | Batch Size (per GPU) | Freezing    |

> Note: Fine-tuning with Zero2 may result in zero loss; Zero3 is recommended for stable training.

## Benchmark Performance

Based on the [GLM-4-9B-0414](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4) foundation model, we present the new open-source VLM model
**GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking**, which introduces a "thinking" paradigm and leverages Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum
Sampling (RLCS) to comprehensively enhance model capabilities.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance among vision-language models at the 10B parameter scale, matching or even
surpassing the 72B Qwen-2.5-VL on 18 benchmark tasks.
We also open-source the base model **GLM-4.1V-9B-Base** to support further research on the frontier of vision-language
models.

## Model Inference

All inference scripts are located in the `inference` folder and include:

- `trans_infer_cli.py`: A command-line interactive script using the `transformers` library as the backend. It supports
  multi-turn dialogue.
- `trans_infer_gradio.py`: A Gradio-based web UI script using the `transformers` backend. It supports multimodal inputs
  such as images, videos, PDFs, and PPTs.
- OpenAI-compatible API service with `vllm`, along with a simple request example provided in `vllm_api_request.py`.

    ```shell
    vllm serve THUDM/GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking --limit-mm-per-prompt '{"image":32}' --allowed-local-media-path /
    ```

  - If `--limit-mm-per-prompt` is not specified, only 1 image is supported. The model supports a maximum of 1 video or
    300 images per input ‚Äî it does **not** support simultaneous image and video inputs.
  - `--allowed-local-media-path` must be set to permit access to local multimodal inputs.

- `trans_infer_bench`: Academic benchmarking script for inference with `GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking`. Key features:
  - Automatically interrupts thinking if it exceeds 8192 tokens and appends `</think><answer>` to prompt the model to
    generate a final answer.
  - Demonstrates video-based input; for other modalities, modifications are required.
  - Only a `transformers` version is provided. For `vLLM`, a custom implementation is needed to support this logic.

- `vllm_request_gui_agent.py`: This script demonstrates how to handle model responses and construct prompts for GUI
  Agent use cases. It covers strategies for mobile, desktop, and web environments, and can be integrated into your
  application framework. For detailed documentation about GUI Agent, please refer to [this file](resources/agent.md).

## Model Fine-tuning

[LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) now supports fine-tuning of this model. Below is an example
dataset using two images. Prepare your dataset in a `finetune.json` file like the following:

```json
[
  {
    "messages": [
      {
        "content": "<image>Who are they?",
        "role": "user"
      },
      {
        "content": "<think>\nUser ask me to observe the image and get the answer. I Know they are Kane and Gretzka from Bayern Munich.</think>\n<answer>They're Kane and Gretzka from Bayern Munich.</answer>",
        "role": "assistant"
      },
      {
        "content": "<image>What are they doing?",
        "role": "user"
      },
      {
        "content": "<think>\nI need to observe what this people are doing. Oh, They are celebrating on the soccer field.</think>\n<answer>They are celebrating on the soccer field.</answer>",
        "role": "assistant"
      }
    ],
    "images": [
      "mllm_demo_data/1.jpg",
      "mllm_demo_data/2.jpg"
    ]
  }
]
```

1. Content inside `<think> ... </think>` will **not** be stored in the conversation history or used during fine-tuning.
2. The `<image>` tag will be replaced with actual image data during preprocessing.

After preparing the dataset, you can proceed with fine-tuning using the standard LLaMA-Factory pipeline.
